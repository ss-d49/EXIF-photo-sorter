# EXIF-photo-sorter
Sorts JPEG images into folders using date taken information in EXIF data.

This is a very simple script to sort photos into folders with the date format YYYY-MM-DD.

Usage is: python datetaken.py

I have not allowed for the ability to accept arguments yet, so the script only sorts all *.jpg images in the folder of execution. I plan to make this script more versatile when I have time.

Dependencies:

Pillow
